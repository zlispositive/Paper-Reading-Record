\item Comments on 05/23/2018 :
\begin{itemize}
\item Accuracy of fluid model of $M/M/n+G$ depends on the state of the system, overloaded, critical-loading, underloaded
\item On the optimization problem:(1) very important to ``linearize'' the original optimization problem by a sanity check on the range of $\rho$; (2) the change of variable by applying $G^{-1}((1-1/\rho)^{+})=w$ is absolutely brilliant; (3) the analysis thereafter is standard but it bring out the importance of monotonicity of the hazard in determining the optimality of system state, i.e., critical-loading, underloaded, or overloaded.
