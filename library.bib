abstract = {We develop and test an integrated forecasting and stochastic programming approach to workforce management in call centers. We first demonstrate that parametric forecasts, discretized using Gaussian quadrature, can be used to drive stochastic programs whose results are stable with relatively small numbers of scenarios. We then extend our approach to include forecast updates and two-stage stochastic programs with recourse and provide a general modeling framework for which recent, related models are special cases. In our formulations, the inclusion of multiple arrival-rate scenarios allows call centers to meet long-run average quality-of-service targets, and the use of recourse actions helps them to lower long-run average costs. Experiments with two large sets of call-center data highlight the complementary nature of these elements. {\textcopyright} 2015 INFORMS.},

abstract = {Motivated by practices in customer contact centers, we consider a system that offers two modes of service: real-time and postponed with a delay guarantee. Customers are informed of anticipated delays and select their preferred option of service. The resulting system is a multiclass, multiserver queueing system with state-dependent arrival rates. We propose an esti-mation scheme for the anticipated real-time delay that is asymptotically correct, and a routing policy that is asymptotically optimal in the sense that it minimizes real-time delay subject to the deadline of the postponed service mode. We also show that our proposed state-dependent scheme performs better than a system in which customers make decisions based on steady-state waiting-time information. Our results are derived using an asymptotic analysis based on " many-server " limits for systems with state-dependent parameters.},

abstract = {We consider queueing systems in which customers arrive according to a Poisson process and have exponentially distributed service requirements. The customers are impatient and may abandon the system while waiting for service after a generally distributed amount of time. The system incurs customer-related costs that consist of waiting and abandonment penalty costs. We study capacity sizing in such systems to minimize the sum of the long-term average customer-related costs and capacity costs. We use fluid models to derive prescriptions that are asymptotically optimal for large customer arrival rates. Although these prescriptions are easy to characterize, they depend intricately upon the distribution of the customers' time to abandon and may prescribe operating in a regime with offered load (the ratio of the arrival rate to the capacity) greater than 1. In such cases, we demonstrate that the fluid prescription is optimal up to OO1. That is, as the customer arrival rate increases, the optimality gap of the prescription remains bounded.},

@article{Whitt1999a,
abstract = {Many service systems have demand that varies significantly by time of day, making it costly to provide sufficient capacity to be able to respond very quickly to each service request. Fortunately, however, different service requests often have very different response-time requirements. Some service requests may need immediate response, while others can tolerate substantial delays. Thus it is often possible to smooth demand by partitioning the service requests into separate priority classes according to their response-time requirements. Classes with more stringent performance requirements are given higher priority for service. Lower capacity may be required if lower-priority-class demand can be met during off-peak periods. We show how the priority classes can be defined and the resulting required fixed capacity can be determined, directly accounting for the time-dependent behavior. For this purpose, we exploit relatively simple analytical models, in particular, Mt/G/∞ and deterministic offered-load models. The analysis also provides an estimate of the capacity savings that can be obtained from partitioning time-varying demand into priority classes.},

abstract = {We consider a call center model with a callback option, which allows to transform an inbound call into an outbound one. A delayed call, with a long anticipated waiting time, receives the option to be called back. We assume a probabilistic customer reaction to the callback offer (option). The objective of the system manager is to characterize the optimal call scheduling that minimizes the expected waiting and abandonment costs. For the single-server case, we prove that non-idling is optimal. Using a Markov decision process approach, we prove for the two-server case that a threshold policy on the number of queued outbound calls is optimal. For the multi-server case, we numerically characterize a switching curve of the number of agents reserved for inbound calls. It is a function of the number of queued outbound calls, the number of busy agents and the identity of jobs in service. We also develop a Markov chain method to evaluate the system performance measures under the optimal policy. We next conduct a numerical study to examine the impact of the policy parameters on the system performance. We observe that the value of the callback offer is especially important for congested situations. It also appears that the benefits of a reservation policy are more apparent in large call centers, while they almost disappear in the extreme situations of light or heavy workloads. We moreover observe in most cases that the callback offer should be given upon arrival to any delayed call. However, if balking and abandonment are very high (which helps to reduce the workload) or if the overall treatment time spent to serve an outbound call is too large compared to that of an inbound one, there is a value in delaying the proposition of the callback offer.},

abstract = {This paper studies how to manage the callback option effectively to mitigate congestion due to temporary surges in the arrivals to a call center. The call arrival process can be an arbitrary point process, allowing uncertainty and temporary surges in the arrival rate, provided that the system is stable. However, particular attention will be paid to the Poisson process with the Cox-Ingresoll-Ross (CIR) process as its stochastic intensity both in our model development and numerical results because of its practical importance, although our theoretical results hold for any arbitrary point process. When a customer arrives, the call center manager reviews the system state and decides whether to keep him in the online queue or to offer the callback option. For each customer in the online queue, she incurs a waiting cost of h per time unit. Similarly, whenever she routes a customer to an offline queue (for a callback later), she incurs a one-time penalty of p. Initially, we allow complete foresight policies that look into the entire future. We first study the case where all customers are willing to accept a callback offer. A simple lookahead policy that looks into the future for the next p/h time units is pathwise optimal among the complete foresight policies. Next, we consider the setting where some customers may reject the callback offer. We show that a modified lookahead policy that looks into the future arrivals and service completion times for the next p/h time units and uses the current number of customers in the system who previously rejected a callback offer (but does not look into the accept/reject decisions of future customers) is pathwise optimal among the complete foresight policies. Building on the insights gleaned from the optimal lookahead policies, we also propose a non-anticipating policy, referred to as the line policy, to decide when to offer the callback option. Lastly, we conduct a simulation study using a dataset from a US bank call center which shows that the line policy has excellent performance.},

@article{Kostami2009,
abstract = {Many service providers offer customers the choice of either waiting in a line or going offline and returning at a dynamically determined future time. The best-known example is the FASTPASS¬{\AE} system at Disneyland. To operate such a system, the service provider must make an upfront decision on how to allocate service capacity between the two lines. Then, during system operation, he must provide estimates of the waiting times for both lines to each arriving customer. The estimation of offline waiting times is complicated by the fact that some offline customers do not return for service at their appointed time. We show that when demand is large and service is fast, for any fixed-capacity allocation decision, the two-dimensional process tracking the number of customers waiting in a line and offline collapses to one dimension, and we characterize the one-dimensional limit process as a reflected diffusion with linear drift. The analytic tractability of this one-dimensional limit process allows us to solve for the capacity allocation that minimizes average cost when there are costs associated with customer abandonments and queueing. We further show that in this limit regime, a simple scheme based on Little's Law to dynamically estimate in line and offline wait times is effective.

abstract = {One prevalent assumption in queueing theory is that the number of servers in a queueing model is deterministic. However, randomness in the number of available servers often arises in practice, e.g., in virtual call centers where agents are allowed to set their own schedules. In this paper, we study the problems of staffing and controlling queueing systems with an uncertain number of servers and impatient customers. Because randomness in the number of servers creates congestion in the system, the customer abandonment distribution plays an important role. We characterize how it affects both the optimal staffing policy and the cost incurred by the manager. Because of strong dependence on the abandonment distribution, it is natural to investigate ways of controlling customer abandonment behavior so as to mitigate that cost. Here, we propose doing so by making delay announcements in the system. We characterize how the manager may use three controls in her toolbox, staffing, compensation, and the announcements, to effectively control her system. We show that despite jointly optimizing the usage of those three controls, it may be cost effective for the manager to understaff, overstaff, or match supply and demand in any given shift. {\textcopyright} 2017 Production and Operations Management Society.},

A key to the dynamic staang is exploiting detailed knowledge of system state in order to obtain good estimates of the mean and variance of the demand in the near future. The near-term staang needs, e.g., for the next minute or the next 20 min., can often be predicted by exploiting information about recent demand and current calls in progress, as well as historical data. The remaining holding times of calls in progress can be predicted by classifying and keeping track of call types, by measuring holding-time distributions and by taking account of the elapsed holding times of calls in progress. The number of new calls in service can be predicted by exploiting information about both historical and recent demand.},
